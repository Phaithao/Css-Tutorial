Summary of what I learned:

  I learned how to create a crossfading slideshow with multiple images that repeats infinitely. I also learned how to change the opacity of an image from a certain amount of percentage to a different amount over time. The thing that I enjoyed learning the most was the animation, I thought it would take more than what it taught me, but I guess not. After testing it out a few times, it was really cool to be able to do this.

Review of the article:
Like/Dislike

  I like how I can put as many images as I want into the slideshow with minimum efforts. Also, there are not much things that are needed to do in order for the slideshow to work. I also like how organized and neat the texts are. Steps are easy to follow and and it tells where you need to put what.

Difficuly of learning:

  The difficulty was easy because the layout have pretty much all the things that I need. The layout was easy to understand and not that difficult at all.  I just need to fill in the missing pieces and test it out. Then make any changes that do I not want or like in there and alter it a bit. Also, when it comes to adding images into it, it's pretty simple since all uses the same function just a little different. It's really easy to use and make one when you have all the images that you need and/or want.
